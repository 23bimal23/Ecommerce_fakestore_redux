# React JS Ecommerce Demo

This project showcases an Ecommerce application built using React.js, TypeScript for type safety, MUI (Material-UI) for UI components, and Tailwind CSS for styling. It incorporates several key features and technologies to provide a seamless shopping experience:

## Key Features
- **Type Safety:** Implemented TypeScript to ensure type safety throughout the codebase.
- **UI Library:** Utilized MUI (Material-UI) for building consistent and responsive UI components.
- **Styling:** CSS was written using Tailwind CSS, offering a streamlined and efficient styling approach.
- **Lazy Loading:** Implemented lazy loading for optimized performance, ensuring resources are loaded only when needed.
- **Private Routes:** Utilized private routes to restrict access to authenticated users only, enhancing security.
- **Fallback Route:** Implemented a fallback route to handle 404 errors or other navigation issues gracefully.
- **Global State Management:** Utilized Redux Toolkit for managing global state, particularly for the shopping cart functionality.
- **Persistent State:** Stored state in Redux using Redux Persist, ensuring that data persists even after page refreshes.
- **Search Functionality:** Implemented a search feature to allow users to easily find products based on keywords.
- **Category Filters:** Added filters to categorize products, making it easier for users to browse specific types of items.
- **Pagination:** Implemented pagination for efficiently navigating through large lists of products.
